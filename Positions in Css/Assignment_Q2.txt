Q2.Explain the difference between Absolute and Relative positioning.

solution:-
           In CSS, absolute positioning places an element relative 
           to its parent's position, changing the layout around it. 
           Relative positioning places an element relative to its 
           default position on the page, taking up space in the 
           normal flow of the page.

 Absolute positioning;-
          1.The position of the element is determined directly towards 
           the GNSS satellites, and only one GNSS receiver is used.
           Absolute positioning defines the position of a given bounding 
           box from the top and left side margins of the web page.
          2.The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no 
           space is created for the element in the page layout. 
           The element is positioned relative to its closest positioned 
           ancestor (if any) or to the initial containing block. 
           Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left.
          

Relative positioning:-
          1.The position of the receiver is determined relative to one or 
          more points with known position. Relative positioning refers 
          to positioning an element relative to its default position on 
          the page.
          2.The element is positioned according to the normal flow of 
          the document, and then offset relative to itself based on 
          the values of top, right, bottom, and left. The offset does 
          not affect the position of any other elements; thus, 
          the space given for the element in the page layout is the 
          same as if position were static.
